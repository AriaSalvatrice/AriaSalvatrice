It's sad. PG gulled you into the hustle. Throwing your life away at the app lottery. Now you try to be hired by making side-projects, at the bottom of which you write "Made with ❤️ in a metropolis where public defecation is commonplace because writing javascripts doesn't solve the lack of public toilets in my city".

Github gave me a README template with a "pronouns" field for my public profile - as if inclusion by CoC of the trans community were sincere, rather than a charade that immediately breaks down when you meet the real thing, and the real thing isn't a polite bourgeois into status games.

The crowd here makes me sick. Talk to me with the mask off or get out of my face.

Also, reminder Github sells software to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which treats immigrants like subhumans.
